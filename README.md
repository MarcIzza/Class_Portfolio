# Marcela's Machine Learning Class Portfolio
Marcela's class portfolio for CS 4375.004, Introduction to Machine Learning. This portfolio will contain information regarding all the projects and topics covered during the course of the semester as well as my deliverables for each assignment. The topics covered range from basic Regression and Classification algorithms performed using R to move complex deep learning techniques using Python.
