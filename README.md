# Marcela's Machine Learning Class Portfolio
Marcela's class portfolio for CS 4375.004, Introduction to Machine Learning. This portfolio will contain information regarding all the projects and topics covered during the course of the semester as well as my deliverables for each assignment. The topics covered range from basic Regression and Classification algorithms performed using R to move complex deep learning techniques using Python.

# Projects and Class Dliverables

* **Overview of Machine Learning**

     [Overview of Machine Learning](OverviewOfMachineLearning.pdf) document that detials a breif Overview of Machine Learning such as the relationship between AI and Machine Learning, definitions of key machine learning terms, and more. Writing this document helped me familizarize myself with the broader aspects of Machine Learning and help prepare me for the topics to come.  


* **Data Exploration**
    
    [Document on Data Exploration](Data_Exploration.pdf) and [Data Exploration Code](DataExploration.cpp). These materials overview data exploration of a csv file dataset in C++. A range of functions were created to mimic basic built in data exploration functions found in R to force a better understanding of what they do. The document also detials some information regarding statistical measures and how they are useful in Machine Learning.


* **Regression and Classification**
   
   [Regression Knit to PDF](Regression.pdf) and [Classification Knit to PDF](Classification.pdf) show machine learning using linear models with Regression and Classification respectively. There is a mdeium-sized data set used forboth of these models and data exploration as well as data cleaning is performed in an effort in imporove the results. The tail of the document includes an overview of the strengths and weaknessess of linear models for regression and classification. 


* **Logistic Regression and Naivie Bayes from Scratch**
    
    Here is my [C++ ML Aglorithims from Scratch Code](C++_Alg_From_Scratch.cpp) and my [Overview Document](C++MLAlgorithmsFromScratch.pdf).


* **Similarity and Ensemble**
    
    Here is [Similarity and Ensemble Part 5 - Narrative Document](Similarity_and_Ensemble-Part_5.pdf).


* **Machine Learning with SKlearn**
    
    Here is my [Machine Learning with SKlearn](Machine_Leanrning_with_SKlearn.pdf) document.


* **Image Classification with Deep Learning**
   
   [Image Classification with Deep Learning](Image_Classification_with_DL.pdf) document descibes creating an image classification algroithim for a dataset of Lions and Cheetas. There are mutiple Classifications models used, such as a sequential model and CNN model, in an effort to improve upon accuracy and get the best results, The end of the document overviews the performace of the different models on the dataset and which perofrmed better.

# Summary and Reflection

When looking back on all that I learned over the course of the semester, I feel that I learned a great deal about Machine Learning and learned countless valuable skills. I had always found Machine Learning deeply interesting but did not act on my interest until last Summer when I had begun working with bots during an internship. This, paired with the increasing publicity coming from ChatGPT pushed me to finally learn more about Machine Learning and all it can do. 

I know the skills I have gained from this class will continue to aid me in the future as I want to go into a software sector that will allow me to utilize and improve my skills in machine learning. However, I have not narrowed myself down to a specific sector yet, so I am unsure whether my interest would lead me to a more data analytical job or something different. What I do know for certain is that I have to keep my interest in Machine Learning active as the field is rapidly evolving and new discoveries are happening every day. I hope a steady interest in this field will keep me from falling too far behind this field even when not directly performing work in it. 

When it comes to future personal projects, I currently have no plans to create a machine learning project as I will be very busy for the next few months, but I will be looking into text classifiers and may be able to put that knowledge to a project eventually.


**I would like to end this reflection with a very special thank you to my professor for this class, Karen Mazidi. Professor Mazidi made this class extremely interesting and engaging and is the entire reason for me gaining the valuable skills listed and described above.**
